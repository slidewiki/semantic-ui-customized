# semantic-ui-customized
this repo is used to build a custom version of semantic-ui for SlideWiki

# How does it work?

We only customize the following files:

`src/theme.config`

`themes/slidewiki`

In order to upgrade it, get the latest version of semantic-ui, overwrite the above files and rebuild the `dist` folder. You then need to manually add it to the `slidewiki-platform` assets.
